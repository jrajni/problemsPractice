We generally saw in most of our programming tests there is a constraint to solve your question in mod(10^9+7).why this statement is so popular?? its just that it is beyond range of long long ,now you should have something to deal with these type of problems.
In solving these type of cases we generally use the concept of modulr arithmetic which provides us basic and derived equation which is helpful to solve these kind of problems.
1).(a+b)mod p=((a mod p)+(b mod p))mod p
2).(a*b)mod p=((a mod p)*(b mod p))mod p
3).(a/b)mod p=?
to understand this equation there is need to understand concept of modular inverse.
MODULAR INVERSE:

a)Modular inverse of A(mod C)is A^-1.
b)(A*A^-1)modC=1
c)only number coprime to C.
